# 概述 | Overview 双语
## VC的作用 | The Role of View Controllers

View controllers are the foundation of your app’s internal structure. Every app has at least one view controller, and most apps have several. Each view controller manages a portion of your app’s user interface as well as the interactions between that interface and the underlying data. View controllers also facilitate transitions between different parts of your user interface.

`View controllers`是应用内部结构的基础。每个应用至少有一个`view controller`，大多数应用都有几个。每个`view controller`管理应用的一部分用户交互界面以及该界面和底层数据之间的交互。`view controller`还有助于用户交互界面不同部分之间的跳转。

Because they play such an important role in your app, view controllers are at the center of almost everything you do. The UIViewController class defines the methods and properties for managing your views, handling events, transitioning from one view controller to another, and coordinating with other parts of your app. You subclass UIViewController (or one of its subclasses) and add the custom code you need to implement your app’s behavior.

因为`view controller`在应用中扮演着如此重要的角色，所以`view controller`几乎是您所做的一切的中心。`UIViewController类`定义了很多方法和属性，用于: 管理视图、处理事件、从一个`view controller`转换到另一个`view controller`以及与应用的其他部分协调。您可以继承`UIViewController`（或着它子类之一）并添加实现您的app所需的自定义代码。

There are two types of view controllers:

有两种类型的`view controller`：

Content view controllers manage a discrete piece of your app’s content and are the main type of view controller that you create.

* `Content view controller`管理应用的多个不同部分，是您创建的主要的`view controller`类型。

Container view controllers collect information from other view controllers (known as child view controllers) and present it in a way that facilitates navigation or presents the content of those view controllers differently.

* `Container view controller`从其他`view controller`（称为`child view controller`）收集信息，以便于导航或以不同方式展示这些`view controller`的内容。

Most apps are a mixture of both types of view controllers.

大多数应用程序是两种类型的`view controller`的混合体。

### 视图管理 | View Management

The most important role of a view controller is to manage a hierarchy of views. Every view controller has a single root view that encloses all of the view controller’s content. To that root view, you add the views you need to display your content. Figure 1-1 illustrates the built-in relationship between the view controller and its views. The view controller always has a reference to its root view and each view has strong references to its subviews.

`view controller`最重要的作用是管理视图的层次结构。每个`view controller`都有一个包含`view controller`所有内容的`root view`。在该`root view`中，您需要添加显示内容所需的`view`。图1-1说明了`view controller`及其`view`之间的内置关系。`view controller`总是对其`root view`有一个引用，每个`view`都对其`子view`有强引用。

Figure 1-1 Relationship between a view controller and its views

图1-1 `view controller`与其视图之间的关系

![VCPG_ControllerHierarchy_fig_1](./images/VCPG_ControllerHierarchy_fig_1-1_2x.png)

NOTE

注

It is common practice to use outlets to access other views in your view controller’s view hierarchy. Because a view controller manages the content of all its views, outlets let you store references to the views that you need. The outlets themselves are connected to the actual view objects automatically when the views are loaded from the storyboard.

通常的做法是使用`outlets`访问`view controller`视图层次结构中的其他视图。因为`view controller`管理其所有视图的内容，`outlets`允许您存储对所需视图的引用。当视图从故事板加载时，`outlets`本身会自动连接到实际的视图对象。

A content view controller manages all of its views by itself. A container view controller manages its own views plus the root views from one or more of its child view controllers. The container does not manage the content of its children. It manages only the root view, sizing and placing it according to the container’s design. Figure 1-2 illustrates the relationship between a split view controller and its children. The split view controller manages the overall size and position of its child views, but the child view controllers manage the actual contents of those views.

一个`content view controller`自行管理其所有视图。一个`container view controller`管理其自己的视图以及来自一个或多个子`view controller`的`root view`。这个容器不管理其`child view`的内容。它只管理`root view`，根据容器的设计调整大小和放置`root view`。图1-2说明了`split view controller`与其`child view`之间的关系。`split view controller`管理其`child views`的整体大小和位置，但`child view controller`管理这些`view`的实际内容。

Figure 1-2 View controllers can manage content from other view controllers

图1-2 `view controller`可以管理来自其他`view controller`的内容

Data Marshaling
### 数据[Marshaling](https:|zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_(%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6))
A view controller acts as an intermediary between the views it manages and the data of your app. The methods and properties of the UIViewController class let you manage the visual presentation of your app. When you subclass UIViewController, you add any variables you need to manage your data in your subclass. Adding custom variables creates a relationship like the one in Figure 1-3, where the view controller has references to your data and to the views used to present that data. Moving data back and forth between the two is your responsibility.

`view controller`充当它管理的视图和应用程序数据之间的中介。`UIViewController类`的方法和属性允许您管理应用程序的外观。当您继承`UIViewController`时，您可以添加任何变量来管理子类中的数据。添加自定义变量会创建一个类似于图1-3中的关系，其中`view controller`引用了您的数据和用于呈现该数据的视图。在两者之间来回移动数据是您的职责。

Figure 1-3A view controller mediates between data objects and views

图1-3A `view controller`在数据对象和视图之间进行中介

![](./images/VCPG_CustomSubclasses_fig_1-3_2x.png)

You should always maintain a clean separation of responsibilities within your view controllers and data objects. Most of the logic for ensuring the integrity of your data structures belongs in the data objects themselves. The view controller might validate input coming from views and then package that input in the format that your data objects require, but you should minimize the view controller’s role in managing the actual data.

您应该始终在`view controller`和数据对象中保持清晰的职责分离。确保数据结构完整性的大部分逻辑属于数据对象本身。`view controller`可能会验证来自视图的输入，然后将输入打包为数据对象所需的格式，但是您应该尽量减少`view controller`在管理实际数据中的作用。

A UIDocument object is one way to manage your data separately from your view controllers. A document object is a controller object that knows how to read and write data to persistent storage. When you subclass, you add whatever logic and methods you need to extract that data and pass it to a view controller or other parts of your app. The view controller might store a copy of any data it receives to make it easier to update views, but the document still owns the true data.

一个`UIDocument`对象是一种与`view controller`分开管理数据的方法。`UIDocument`对象是一个控制器对象，它知道如何读取和写入数据到持久存储。当您子类化时，您可以添加提取数据所需的任何逻辑和方法，并将其传递给`view controller`或应用程序的其他部分。`view controller`可能会存储它接收到的任何数据的副本，以便更容易更新视图，但文档仍然拥有真实的数据。

### 用户交互 | User Interactions

View controllers are responder objects and are capable of handling events that come down the responder chain. Although they are able to do so, view controllers rarely handle touch events directly. Instead, views usually handle their own touch events and report the results to a method of an associated delegate or target object, which is usually the view controller. So most events in a view controller are handled using delegate methods or action methods.

`view controller`是[`responder`](https:|developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/Devpedia-CocoaApp/Responder.html#|apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009071-CH1)对象，能够处理响应者链中的事件。尽管它们能够这样做，`view controller`很少直接处理触摸事件。相反，视图通常处理自己的触摸事件，并将结果报告给关联的`delegate`或`target object`的方法，这通常是`view controller`。因此，`view controller`中的大多数事件都是使用`delegate methods`或`action methods`来处理的。

For more information about implementing action methods in your view controller, see Handling User Interactions. For information about handling other types of events, see Event Handling Guide for iOS.

有关在`view controller`中实现操作方法的详细信息，请参阅处理用户交互。有关处理其他类型事件的信息，请参阅iOS的事件处理指南[|原文](https:|developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/DefiningYourSubclass.html#|apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007457-CH7-SW11)。

### 资源管理 | Resource Management

A view controller assumes all responsibility for its views and any objects that it creates. The UIViewController class handles most aspects of view management automatically. For example, UIKit automatically releases any view-related resources that are no longer needed. In your UIViewController subclasses, you are responsible for managing any objects you create explicitly.

`view controller`对其视图及其创建的任何对象承担所有责任。`UIViewController`类自动处理视图管理的大多数方面。例如，`UIKit`自动释放不再需要的任何与视图相关的资源。在您的`UIViewController子类`中，您负责管理您显式创建的任何对象。

When the available free memory is running low, UIKit asks apps to free up any resources that they no longer need. One way it does this is by calling the didReceiveMemoryWarning method of your view controllers. Use that method to remove references to objects that you no longer need or can recreate easily later. For example, you might use that method to remove cached data. It is important to release as much memory as you can when a low-memory condition occurs. Apps that consume too much memory may be terminated outright by the system to recover memory.

当可用内存不足时，`UIKit`会要求应用程序释放它们不再需要的任何资源。一种方法是调用`view controller`的`didReceiveMemoryWarning`方法。使用该方法删除对不再需要或以后可以轻松重新创建的对象的引用。例如，您可以使用该方法删除缓存数据。当内存不足的情况发生时，尽可能多地释放内存非常重要。消耗过多内存的应用程序可能会被系统直接终止以恢复内存。


### 设备适配 | Adaptivity

View controllers are responsible for the presentation of their views and for adapting that presentation to match the underlying environment. Every iOS app should be able to run on iPad and on several different sizes of iPhone. Rather than provide different view controllers and view hierarchies for each device, it is simpler to use a single view controller that adapts its views to the changing space requirements.

`view controller`负责其视图的呈现，并调整该呈现以匹配底层环境。每个iOS应用程序都应该能够在iPad和几种不同尺寸的iPhone上运行。与其为每个设备提供不同的`view controller`和视图层次结构，不如使用单个`view controller`来调整其视图以适应不断变化的空间要求。

In iOS, view controllers need to handle coarse-grained changes and fine-grained changes. Coarse-grained changes happen when a view controller’s traits change. Traits are attributes that describe the overall environment, such as the display scale. Two of the most important traits are the view controller’s horizontal and vertical size classes, which indicate how much space the view controller has in the given dimension. You can use size class changes to change the way you lay out your views, as shown in Figure 1-4. When the horizontal size class is regular, the view controller takes advantage of the extra horizontal space to arrange its content. When the horizontal size class is compact, the view controller arranges its content vertically.

在iOS中，`view controller`需要处理粗粒度的更改和细粒度的更改。当`view controller`的`traits(特征、表征/treɪt/)`发生变化时，就会发生粗粒度的更改。`traits`是描述整体环境的属性，例如显示比例。两个最重要的`traits`是`view controller`的水平和垂直的`size class`，它们指示了`view controller`在给定维度中有多少空间。您可以使用`size class`的更改来更改视图的布局方式，如图1-4所示。当水平`size class`是 *regular(规则)* 的时，`view controller`利用额外的水平空间来排列其内容。当水平`size class`是 *compact(紧凑)* 的时，`view controller`垂直排列其内容。

Figure 1-4 Adapting views to size class changes

图1-4 使视图适应`size class`的变化

![](./images/VCPG_SizeClassChanges_fig_1-4_2x.png)

Within a given size class, it is possible for more fine-grained size changes to occur at any time. When the user rotates an iPhone from portrait to landscape, the size class might not change but the screen dimensions usually change. When you use Auto Layout, UIKit automatically adjusts the size and position of views to match the new dimensions. View controllers can make additional adjustments as needed.

在给定的`size class`中，可以随时进行更细粒度的尺寸更改。当用户将iPhone从纵向旋转到横向时，`size class`可能不会改变，但屏幕尺寸通常会改变。当您使用自动布局时，UIKit会自动调整视图的大小和位置以匹配新的尺寸。`view controller`可以根据需要进行额外的调整。

For more information about adaptivity, see The Adaptive Model.

有关适应性的更多信息，请参阅自适应模型[|原文](https:|developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/TheAdaptiveModel.html#|apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007457-CH19-SW1)。

## `view controller`层次结构 | [The View Controller Hierarchy](https:|developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/index.html#|apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007457-CH2-SW1)

The relationships among your app’s view controllers define the behaviors required of each view controller. UIKit expects you to use view controllers in prescribed ways. Maintaining the proper view controller relationships ensures that automatic behaviors are delivered to the correct view controllers when they are needed. If you break the prescribed containment and presentation relationships, portions of your app will stop behaving as expected.

app 的 `view controller`之间的关系，定义了每个`view controller`所需的行为。`UIKit`预期是您以规范的方式来使用`view controller`。维护`view controller`的正确关系，可确保在需要时，将自动行为传递给正确的`view controller`。如果您破坏了规范的包含和表示关系，您的应用程序的某些部分将不会按预期运行。

### `root view Controller` | `The Root View Controller`

The root view controller is the anchor of the view controller hierarchy. Every window has exactly one root view controller whose content fills that window. The root view controller defines the initial content seen by the user. Figure 2-1 shows the relationship between the root view controller and the window. Because the window has no visible content of its own, the view controller’s view provides all of the content.

`root view controller`是`view controller`层次结构的锚`anchor`。每个`window`都有一个`root view controller`，其内容填充该`wondow`。`root view controller`定义用户看到的初始内容。图2-1显示了`root view controller`和`wondow`之间的关系。因为`wondow`本身没有可见内容，`view controller`的视图提供了所有内容。

Figure 2-1 The root view controller

图2-1 `root view controller`

![](./images/VCPG-root-view-controller_2-1_2x.png)

The root view controller is accessible from the rootViewController property of the UIWindow object. When you use storyboards to configure your view controllers, UIKit sets the value of that property automatically at launch time. For windows you create programmatically, you must set the root view controller yourself.

`root view controller`可从`UIWindow`对象的[`rootViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwindow/1621581-rootviewcontroller)属性访问。当您使用故事板配置`view controller`时，`UIKit`会在启动时自动设置该属性的值。对于以编程方式创建的窗口，您必须自己设置`root view controller`。

### `container view controller` | Container View Controllers

Container view controllers let you assemble sophisticated interfaces from more manageable and reusable pieces. A container view controller mixes the content of one or more child view controllers together with optional custom views to create its final interface. For example, a UINavigationController object displays the content from a child view controller together with a navigation bar and optional toolbar, which are managed by the navigation controller. UIKit includes several container view controllers, including UINavigationController, UISplitViewController, and UIPageViewController.

`container view controller`允许您使用更易于管理和可重用的部分来组装复杂的界面。`container view controller`将一个或多个子`view controller`的内容与可选的自定义视图混合在一起，以创建其最终界面。例如，`UINavigationController`对象显示`child view controller`的内容以及导航栏和可选工具栏，它们由`navigation controller`管理。`UIKit`包括几个`container view controller`，包括[`UINavigationController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller)、[`UISplitViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisplitviewcontroller)和[`UIPageViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipageviewcontroller?language=objc)。

A container view controller’s view always fills the space given to it. Container view controllers are often installed as root view controllers in a window (as shown in Figure 2-2), but they can also be presented modally or installed as children of other containers. The container is responsible for positioning its child views appropriately. In the figure, the container places the two child views side by side. Although it depends on the container interface, child view controllers may have minimal knowledge of the container and any sibling view controllers.

`container view controller`的视图总是填满给它的空间。`container view controller`常作为`root view controller`配置在`window`中（如图2-2所示），但它们也可以模块化地呈现或作为其他容器的子视图。容器负责适当地定位其子视图。在图中，容器将两个子视图并排放置。尽管它依赖于容器接口，但子视图控制器可能对容器和任何兄弟视图控制器的了解非常少。

Figure 2-2A container acting as the root view controller

图2-2A 容器充当根视图控制器

![](./images/VCPG-container-acting-as-root-view-controller_2-2_2x.png)

Because a container view controller manages its children, UIKit defines rules for how you set up those children in custom containers. For detailed information about how to create a custom container view controller, see Implementing a Container View Controller.

因为`container view controller`管理其子VC，`UIKit`定义了如何在自定义容器中设置这些子VC的规则。有关如何创建自定义`container view controller`的详细信息，请参阅实现`container view controller` | [原文](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/ImplementingaContainerViewController.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007457-CH11-SW1)。


### 呈现`view controller` | Presented View Controllers

Presenting a view controller replaces the current view controller’s contents with those of a new one, usually hiding the previous view controller’s contents. Presentations are most often used for displaying new content modally. For example, you might present a view controller to gather input from the user. You can also use them as a general building block for your app’s interface.

呈现`view controller`会将当前`view controller`的内容替换为新`view controller`的内容，通常隐藏以前的`view controller`的内容。这种呈现VC的方法最常用于模态显示新内容。例如，您可以呈现一个`view controller`来收集用户的输入。您还可以将它们用作应用程序界面的通用功能。

When you present a view controller, UIKit creates a relationship between the presenting view controller and the presented view controller, as shown in Figure 2-3. (There is also a reverse relationship from the presented view controller back to its presenting view controller.) These relationships form part of the view controller hierarchy and are a way to locate other view controllers at runtime.

当您呈现`view controller`时，`UIKit`会在将呈现的`view controller`和已呈现`view controller`之间创建关系，如图2-3所示。（从已呈现的`view controller`到其将呈现`view controller`也有构件反向的关系。）这些关系构成了`view controller`层次结构的一部分，并且是在运行时定位其他`view controller`的一种方式。

Figure 2-3 Presented view controllers

图2-3 被呈现的`view controller`

![](./images/VCPG-presented-view-controllers_2-3_2x.png)

When container view controllers are involved, UIKit may modify the presentation chain to simplify the code you have to write. Different presentation styles have different rules for how they appear onscreen—for example, a full-screen presentation always covers the entire screen. When you present a view controller, UIKit looks for a view controller that provides a suitable context for the presentation. In many cases, UIKit chooses the nearest container view controller but it might also choose the window’s root view controller. In some cases, you can also tell UIKit which view controller defines the presentation context and should handle the presentation.

当涉及`container view controller`时，`UIKit`可能会修改`presentation chain`以简化您必须编写的代码。不同的呈现样式对它们在屏幕上的呈现方式有不同的规则——例如，全屏呈现总是覆盖整个屏幕。当您呈现`view controller`时，UIKit会寻找为呈现提供合适上下文的`view controller`。在许多情况下，UIKit会选择最近的`container view controller`，但也可能会选择窗口的`root view controller`。在某些情况下，您还可以告诉UIKit哪个`view controller`定义了演示上下文并应该处理演示。

Figure 2-4 shows why containers usually provide the context for a presentation. When performing a full-screen presentation, the new view controller needs to cover the entire screen. Rather than requiring the child to know the bounds of its container, the container decides whether to handle the presentation. Because the navigation controller in the example covers the entire screen, it acts as the presenting view controller and initiates the presentation.

图2-4 说明了为何容器通常为呈现VC提供上下文。当执行全屏呈现时，新的`view controller`需要覆盖整个屏幕。容器决定是否处理呈现，而不是要求`child VC`知道其容器的边界。因为示例中的`navigation controller`覆盖了整个屏幕，所以它充当将要呈现的`view controller`并启动呈现。

## 设计技巧 | Design Tips

View controllers are an essential tool for apps running on iOS, and the view controller infrastructure of UIKit makes it easy to create sophisticated interfaces without writing a lot of code. When implementing your own view controllers, use the following tips and guidelines to ensure that you are not doing things that might interfere with the natural behavior expected by the system.

视图控制器是在iOS上运行的应用程序必不可少的工具，UIKit的视图控制器基础架构使得无需编写大量代码即可轻松创建复杂的界面。在实现您自己的视图控制器时，请使用以下提示和指南来确保您没有做可能干扰系统预期的自然行为的事情。

### 尽可能使用系统提供的视图控制器 | Use System-Supplied View Controllers Whenever Possible

Many iOS frameworks define view controllers that you can use as-is in your apps. Using these system-supplied view controllers saves time for you and ensures a consistent experience for the user.

iOS框架定义了许多在app中可以直接使用的视图控制器。使用这些系统提供的视图控制器可以为您节省时间并确保一致的用户体验。

Most system view controllers are designed for specific tasks. Some view controllers provide access to user data such as contacts. Others might provide access to hardware or provide specially tuned interfaces for managing media. For example, the UIImagePickerController class in UIKit displays a standard interface for capturing pictures and video and for accessing the user’s camera roll.

大多数系统视图控制器是为特定任务设计的。一些视图控制器提供对用户数据（如联系人）的访问。其他可能提供对硬件的访问或提供用于管理媒体的特别调整的界面。例如，UIKit中的`UIImagePickerController`类显示了一个用于捕获图片和视频以及访问用户相机胶卷的标准界面。

Before you create your own custom view controller, look at the existing frameworks to see if a view controller already exists for the task you want to perform.

在创建自己的自定义视图控制器之前，请查看现有框架, 看看是否已经存在用于您要执行的任务的视图控制器。

::: danger IMPORTANT
Never modify the view hierarchy of system-provided view controllers. Each view controller owns its view hierarchy and is responsible for maintaining the integrity of that hierarchy. Making changes might introduce bugs into your code or prevent the owning view controller from operating correctly. In the case of system view controllers, always rely on the publicly available methods and properties of the view controller to make all modifications.
:::

::: danger 重要
切勿修改系统提供的视图控制器的视图层次结构。每个视图控制器都拥有其视图层次结构，并负责维护该层次结构的完整性。进行更改可能会在代码中引入错误或阻止拥有的视图控制器正常运行。对于系统视图控制器，始终依赖视图控制器的公开可用方法和属性进行所有修改。

### 使每个视图控制器成为一个孤岛 ｜ Make Each View Controller an Island

View controllers should always be self-contained objects. No view controller should have knowledge about the internal workings or view hierarchy of another view controller. In cases where two view controllers need to communicate or pass data back and forth, they should always do so using explicitly defined public interfaces.

视图控制器应该始终是自包含的对象。任何视图控制器都不应该了解另一个视图控制器的内部工作或视图层次结构。如果两个视图控制器需要来回通信或传递数据，它们应该始终使用明确定义的公共接口进行通信。

The delegation design pattern is frequently used to manage communication between view controllers. With delegation, one object defines a protocol for communicating with an associated delegate object, which is any object that conforms to the protocol. The exact type of the delegate object is unimportant. All that matters is that it implements the methods of the protocol.

经常使用委托设计模式来管理视图控制器之间的通信。通过委托，一个对象定义了一个与关联委托对象通信的协议，委托对象是符合协议的任何对象。委托对象的确切类型并不重要。重要的是它实现了协议的方法。

### 仅将根视图用作其他视图的容器 ｜ Use the Root View Only as a Container for Other Views

Use the root view of your view controller solely as a container for the rest of your content. Using the root view as a container gives all of your views a common parent view, which makes many layout operations simpler. Many Auto Layout constraints require a common parent view to lay out the views properly.

仅将视图控制器的根视图用作其余内容的容器。将根视图用作容器为所有视图提供了一个通用的父视图，这使得许多布局操作更简单。许多自动布局约束需要一个通用的父视图来正确布局视图。

### 知道您的数据存储在哪里 ｜ Know Where Your Data Lives

In the model-view-controller design pattern, a view controller’s role is to facilitate the movement of data between your model objects and your view objects. A view controller might store some data in temporary variables and perform some validation, but its main responsibility is to ensure that its views contain accurate information. Your data objects are responsible for managing the actual data and for ensuring the overall integrity of that data.

在MVC设计模式中，视图控制器的作用是促进模型对象和视图对象之间的数据移动。视图控制器可能将一些数据存储在临时变量中并执行一些验证，但它的主要职责是确保其视图包含准确的信息。您的数据对象负责管理实际数据并确保该数据的整体完整性。

An example of the separation of data and interface exists in the relationship between the UIDocument and UIViewController classes. Specifically, no default relationship exists between the two. A UIDocument object coordinates the loading and saving of data, while a UIViewController object coordinates the display of views onscreen. If you create a relationship between the two objects, remember that the view controller should only cache information from the document for efficiency. The actual data still belongs to the document object.

数据和接口分离的一个例子存在于`UIDocument`和`UIViewController`类之间的关系中。具体来说，两者之间不存在默认关系。`UIDocument`对象处理数据的加载和保存，而`UIViewController`对象处理视图在屏幕上的显示。如果您在两个对象之间创建关系，请记住视图控制器应该只缓存`UIDocument`中的信息以提高效率。实际数据仍然属于`UIDocument`对象。

### 设备适配 | Adapt to Changes

Apps can run on a variety of iOS devices, and view controllers are designed to adapt to different-sized screens on those devices. Rather than use separate view controllers to manage content on different screens, use the built-in adaptivity support to respond to size and size class changes in your view controllers. The notifications sent by UIKit give you the opportunity to make both large-scale and small-scale changes to your user interface without having to change the rest of your view controller code.

应用程序可以在各种iOS设备上运行，视图控制器旨在适应这些设备上不同大小的屏幕。与其使用单独的视图控制器来管理不同屏幕上的内容，不如使用内置的适应性支持来响应视图控制器中的`size`和`size class`更改。UIKit发送的通知使您有机会对用户交互界面进行大粒度和小粒度的更改，而无需更改视图控制器的其余代码。

For more information about handling adaptivity changes, see The Adaptive Model.
